## Customer Details Portal
## Overview
This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript that displays a customer details portal. The portal features a list of customers on the left side and shows detailed information about the selected customer on the right side. The application supports infinite scrolling for the customer list and dynamically updates a grid of photos every 10 seconds using a public API.

## Features
Customer List: Displays a list of up to 1000 customers on the left side.

Each card in the list shows the customer's name and title.
Clicking on a card shows detailed information about the selected customer on the right side.
The selected card is highlighted.

Customer Details: Shows detailed information about the selected customer on the right side.

Includes the customer's name, title, address, and a 3x3 grid of 9 photos.
The photos in the grid change every 10 seconds. (The API has a rate limit)
Infinite Scrolling: The customer list supports infinite scrolling, loading more customers as the user scrolls down.

##Best Practices Followed
Component-Based Architecture: The application is broken down into reusable components.
TypeScript: Used for type safety and better developer experience - User type to define the User.
React Hooks: Utilized for state management and side effects - useEffect and useState.
TailwinfCSSCSS: Modular and scoped styling for each component. Minimal style maintained.
Error Handling: Proper error handling for API requests.
Infinite Scrolling: Implemented using the IntersectionObserver API
